**Work in progress ðŸ”§**

TCP Socket server to handle many automated sessions for my needs and for fun.

Client --> Windows<br/>
Server --> Linux

To Do:

- Change Server (sessions system) need to be easier to maintain & use
- Use poll() with nonblocking sockets
- With poll() use something like an event handler so a client can drop his connection and keep going where he left
- Use cryptopp ? to encrypt traffic (maybe)
